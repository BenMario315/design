# design-patterns

23 design patterns.

This is the basic implementation of the most classic 23 common design patterns. 

Maybe you can refer to learning when you don't know the design pattern, or if you need to do architectural design, you have to use some design patterns or have to refer to some design patterns to create new design patterns.

There is no inevitable connection between each design pattern, so you can look directly at what you are interested in. 

If there is any error, please also point out that I will modify it in time. So as not to mislead others.

thank you.
